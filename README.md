Multimodal GenAI Assistant is a ChatGPT-style AI application built using Streamlit and Gemini LLM that combines conversational AI, document understanding, and video summarization into a single unified interface. The system supports text, voice, and document inputs while maintaining summarized memory to optimize token usage and improve performance.
Unlike traditional chatbots, this project integrates multiple AI workflows — including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), YouTube transcript summarization, and real-time conversational memory — inside a single modular architecture designed for real-world AI engineering practices.
The application demonstrates practical implementation of Generative AI systems with secure API handling, modular backend structure, and scalable design suitable for deployment on cloud platforms.
